Edit this template to customise the "account activation" HTML email your
users will receive.

If you are adding URLs into this, remember that only absolute URLS (with
a domain name) make sense in email! They can be served from any stable
location, including your Galaxy server or GitHub.

The following variables are available for inserting into the html with Jinja2
syntax, like {{ variable_name }}. They will be rendered into the text before
the email is sent:

- name The user's name
- user_email The user's email
- date Date of registration
- hostname Your galaxy's hostname
- activation_url The account activation URL
- terms_url Your T&Cs URL
- contact_email Your galaxy's contact email
- instance_resource_url Your galaxy's resource website URL
- expiry_days Days until the activation link expires
- custom_message Your Galaxy config custom_activation_email_message
